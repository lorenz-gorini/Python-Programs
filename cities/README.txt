#Cities

The program does the following:

- It takes the names of 3 cities as an input (e.g. Milan, Helsinki, Berlin)

- It calculates the total map distance to visit the cities in the given order (no need to think about the shortest path). 

E.g TotalDistance = (Distance Milan / Helsinki) + (Distance Helsinki / Berlin).

The program uses an external service (some map APIs like google maps) to get the coordinates of a city given its name.

Some explanations of the program can be found on the main.py comments.
