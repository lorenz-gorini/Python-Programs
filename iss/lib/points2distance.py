  """
    Calculate distance (in kilometers) between two points given as (long, latt) pairs
    based on Haversine formula (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).
    Implementation inspired by JavaScript implementation from http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html
    IT RETURNS THE DISTANCE IN KILOMETERS
    Accepts coordinates as tuples (deg, min, sec), but coordinates can be given in any form - e.g.
    can specify only minutes:
    (0, 3133.9333, 0) 
    is interpreted as 
    (52.0, 13.0, 55.998000000008687)
    which, not accidentally, is the lattitude of Warsaw, Poland.
  """
  start_long = math.radians(start[0])

    from the main, then it can assign two specific values 
    ( instead of getting the two parameters from the main )
