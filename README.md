# PythonPrograms

Two Python programs I created for an interview to prove my skills.
They are meant to be just a draft.

# 1. ISS 
It uses an API to get the position of ISS right now and it calculates the average speed after a certain time
It also uses a library with maps of Google Maps to draw the path of ISS and it stores the picture in a HTML file

# 2. Cities
It asks the user to input the name of 2 or more cities. 
Then it calls an API which returns the latitude and longitude of the cities with that name (the program considers the first of the list).
Finally the program calculates the distance among all the cities (in the same order as they are input)
